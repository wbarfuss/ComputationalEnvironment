    "> Science is one of humanity's greatest inventions. Academia, on the other hand, is not. It is remarkable how successful science has been, given the often chaotic habits of scientists. In contrast to other fields, [...] science as a profession is largely *unprofessional*â€”apprentice scientists are taught less about how to work responsibly than about how to earn promotions. This results in ubiquitous and costly errors."

    "**Transparency** is required **because all models are wrong**. Our brains have limited capacity to process the already limited data we receive from the complex world around us, so we simplify. Most often, we do this subconsciously, resulting in a mental model. We use formal models -- computational and mathematical ones -- to make the process of simplification and abstraction a conscious effort. Since a model, by definition, can nor aims to be true, we should optimize the model design and presentation for transparency to **make the conscious modeling thought process a collective one**. Transparency enables reproducibility and collaboration."
